## Running the pipeline

### Work around a bug in Nexflow

In theory you should be able to run this pipeline as:

```bash
nextflow run https://vcs.eva.mpg.de/visagie/sediment_nf
```

â€¦**but this does not work** due to a bug in Nextflow. I have reported the bug, but until it is fixed the following workaround can be used:
 
1. Create a tiny file that will define a configuration profile for `vcs.eva`:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p "${HOME}/.nextflow" && curl -s https://vcs.eva.mpg.de/visagie/sediment_nf/snippets/8/raw >"${HOME}/.nextflow/scm"
   ```

   *You only have to do this once!*
   
2. Pull the pipeline to your local account with the following command:

   ```bash
   nextflow pull visagie/sediment_nf -hub eva
   ```
   
   *You only have to do this once as well!*
   
3. Refer to the pipeline as `visagie/sediment_nf` in all Nextflow commands, e.g.:

   ```bash
   nextflow run visagie/sediment_nf --db /some/database
   ```
   
4. When Nextflow notifies you that there is a newer version of the pipeline, you may update your local copy with:

   ```bash
   nextflow pull visagie/sediment_nf
   ```
