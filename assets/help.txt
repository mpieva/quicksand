Usage: nextflow run mpieva/quicksand -r v1.5 {--bam PATH --rg PATH | --split DIR} --db PATH --genome PATH --bedfiles PATH [options] -profile singularity 
    
required arguments:
  Either:
  --bam 	PATH   		Multiplexed input BAM file (merged)
  --rg  	PATH  		tab-separated file containing index combinations
                     		- format of file: 'LibID<tab>P7<tab>P5'
  Or:
  --split 	DIR		directory with already split files
                     		- format of files within: 'Readgroup.{bam, fastq, fastq.gz, fq.gz, fq}'
                     		- Note: Files will be interpreted as merged, PR reads are filtered out by default, PR fastq files are imported to bam as SE 
  And:
  --db 		DIR   		 Path to Kraken database dir
  --genomes 	DIR    		 Path to directory with reference genomes for alignment
  --bedfiles 	DIR 		 Path to directory with bedfiles masking the genomes for alignment
      
optional arguments:
  --specmap 	PATH     	Path to a config-file. Specify for a family one or more species. Reads assigned to this family (kraken) are mapped to these species
                    		- format of file: 'Family<tab>Species_name,Species_name'
                     		- Species_name must correspond to the filename in the genomes diretory
  --skip_bed 	STRING   	comma-separated list of families that are ommited from bedfiltering (e.g. 'Homindae, Hyaenidae')
  --skip_analyze     		Skip the DNA-deamination-analysis at the end of the run
  --skip_report      		Skip the creation of the comprehensive summary file "final_report.tsv" at the end of the run
  --byrg             		Structure the content of the "out" directory by readgroup instead of taxonomy 
  --taxlvl           		'f' or 'o'. The taxonomic level used for extracting and mapping assignments by kraken against the reference genomes (default: f).
                     		- e.g. if 'o' is picked, reads assigned to 'Primates' will be mapped to 'Homo_sapiens' reference genomes instead of only the 'Hominidae' reads
                     		- the reference genomes are still picked by the best guess per family 
  
  --bamfilter_length_cutoff 	N	length cutoff for extracted bam (default: 35)
  --bamfilter_quality_cutoff 	N       quality filter for extracted bam (default: 25)
  --krakenuniq_min_kmers	N      	Filter: minimal required unique kmers (krakenuniq) assigned to a family (default: 129)
  --krakenuniq_min_reads 	N      	Filter: minimal required number of reads assigend to a family by krakenuniq (default: 3)     
  --bamfilterflag 		N  	The filter used for filter the input bam files (default: 1)
                     			- The flags are the official bitwise flags specified by the BAM format
                     			- 0: no filter, 1: filter paired, 4: filter unmapped, 5: filter both
  
  --compression_level 		N       set BGZF compression level (default: 0)
